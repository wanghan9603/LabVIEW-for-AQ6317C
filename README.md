# LabVIEW-for-AQ6317C
A LabVIEW project for Optical Spectrum Analyzer AQ6317C

Version: <strong>LabVIEW 2017</strong><Br>
Before starting this program, the <a href="http://sine.ni.com/apps/utf8/niid_web_display.download_page?p_id_guid=192BC15B39DB2023E05400144FFA2D85">instrument drive</a> should be installed firstly.

This is a LabVIEW project used for controling Optical Spectrum Analyzer AQ6317C.
The AQ6317C is a high-precision, wide-wavelength-range spectrometer produced by ANDO (Now is Yokogawa), which was discontinued in 2006.
This spectrometer does not have an official supporting computer operating software, and capturing data have to be copied using a floppy disk.
There is a GPIB interface on the spectrometer, and all system functions can be remotely controlled via the GPIB interface.
